## My process

I started with organizing the HTML file, then css, then js!

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox 
- Bootstrap
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript
- JQuery

### Continued development

I'd like to continue focusing on javascript and jquery. Additionally, the application of bootstrap and flex can also use some more work. I'd like to also continue working on form validation and accessibility.
